# 🛠️ My Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This is where I keep configuration files for my development environment, terminal, and tools. These files help me keep my setup consistent across machines and can be easily bootstrapped on new systems.

## 📁 What's Included?

This repository includes configuration for:

- **Shell** (`bash`)
- **Terminal** (`alacritty`, `ghostty`, `kitty`)

- **Window manager / DE** (`hyprland`)
- **Development tools** (`lazygit`, `starship`)
